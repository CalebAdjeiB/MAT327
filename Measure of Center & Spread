Analyzed 3 data columns: age, ejection fraction, and serum sodium
Measure of Center & Spread of Age:
mean = 60.83389
median = 60
variance = 141.4865
standard deviation = 11.89481
The mean and median are roughly close/same, which is expected because it has a symmetric shape distribution.
The standard deviation is also expected because approximately half the data values lie to the left and right of the mean, and are not too close to the mean.

Measure of Center & Spread of Ejection Fraction:
mean = 38.08361
median = 38
variance = 140.0635
standard deviation = 11.83484
The mean and median values are much closer, classifying the distribution as symmetric.
The standard deviation shares similar qualities to that of the age dataset. The values are also farther from the mean.

Measure of Center and spread of Serum sodium:
Mean = 136.6254
median = 137
variance = 19.46996
standard deviation =  4.412477
The mean and median values are surprisingly close to the median > mean but this can be expected since a majority of values fall between 135 < x < 140 (greatest frequency).
The standard deviation is quite low due to the majority of the data falling between 135 < x < 140.
